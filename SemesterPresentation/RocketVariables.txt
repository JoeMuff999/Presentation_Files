Falcon 9 Full thrust is what i shall do.


These are all input variables? do i want to change force on the fly, or do i want to keep it the same and just multiply by angles?

Final Plan (for now): Thrust will stay the same with init_thrust variable, thrust[0] will be x thrust, thrust[1] will be y thrust. thrust[0] = cos(init_angle)
thrust [1] = cos(init_angle) --- for initializing

later, these will be set to thrust values where init_angle --> angle.

---------

initial state variables VVVV

init_thrust = initial thrust (will always be the same) 

Velocity0: idk why but its just gonna be 0 0

Position0: same as before, just gonna be 0 0

init_angle = starts 0

mass = use for f =ma calculations.

gravityForce = mass * accelGrav, use for force calculations with thrust	

-------- 

changing variables VVVV

Thrust (array of 2 nums): x and y thrust (take init_thrust * sin/cos(init_angle).

drag = just basic drag coefficient, gonna leave it out at first though, xy variables, no point initializing though, comment it out

acc= will change with the various forces for both x and y

vel = change based on acceleration

pos = acknowledge existence :)

angle = will just set it an arbitrary point to simplify initial calculations then later will change it to be more realistic.
------

time = just second based run time

impact = 0 or 1 for false or true (no bool wow)

impactTime = name
